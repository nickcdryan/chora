Multi-Stream Text Editor: Project Summary
The Goal
Create a specialized text editor for writing multi-voice narratives - stories told through multiple simultaneous "voices" or perspectives, inspired by musical composition structures like choir arrangements (soprano, alto, tenor, bass).
The Writing Style
Multi-layered storytelling where different voices run in parallel, for example

Voice 1 (Sensory): Environmental observations, brief moments - "Morning light filtering through dust"
Voice 2 (Narrative): Main story progression - "David walked through the market stalls, remembering childhood visits"
Voice 3 (Commentary): Internal thoughts, meta-reflection - "memory is such a persistent tourist"

And if required the author can add or remove voices as needed

Each voice can be any length and wraps independently while maintaining visual relationship to the others.
Specifically, voices may have large gaps of white space while other voices take focus to prevent too much density and to make it clearer where the reader should focus.
Why We Built This
Existing tools fail at this format:

Word processors: Tables become unwieldy for long text, no automatic reflow
Multi-column layouts: Text flows left-to-right instead of voice-to-voice
Separate documents: Lose visual relationship between voices
LaTeX: Requires manual chunk management, too technical for most writers

What was needed: An editor where the ontology is fundamentally different:

Regular text editor: endless lines going down
Our editor: endless chunks going down, each containing n parallel streams

Technical Specifications
Core Architecture

Document/View separation: Like professional text editors (VS Code, Word)
Document model: Each voice stored as one continuous text string
View model: Automatically breaks text into visual chunks with real-time reflow

Text Handling

Real-time text measurement: Uses actual browser font metrics
Smart word wrapping: Breaks at word boundaries, handles spaces properly
Independent streams: Each voice wraps to its continuation without affecting others
Cursor preservation: Maintains cursor position across automatic reflows

User Experience

Natural text editing: ContentEditable divs with browser's proven text engine
Automatic chunk creation: New chunks appear as streams overflow
Keyboard navigation: Tab between streams, Ctrl+arrows between chunks
Visual indicators: Colored borders distinguish voices, chunk numbers on hover

File System

Human-readable format: YAML metadata + structured text chunks
Multiple exports: HTML (web sharing), LaTeX (professional typesetting), standalone files
Extensible: Version field and metadata header for future features
Readable without app: Clear structure even in plain text editors

Key Innovation
Independent text streams with automatic reflow - each voice behaves like a separate document but maintains visual synchronization through shared chunks. When you edit anywhere in Voice 1, all Voice 1 chunks immediately reflow, while Voices 2 and 3 remain unaffected.
This creates the illusion of writing in parallel columns while actually managing multiple independent text streams that flow naturally like any standard text editor.
Result
A specialized writing tool that enables a new form of literary expression - multi-voice narratives that can be written as naturally as regular text, but displayed and published in sophisticated parallel formats previously only possible with complex typesetting systems.
Perfect for: Experimental fiction, academic annotations, translation work, technical documentation with multiple perspectives, or any writing that benefits from simultaneous parallel voices.
